# Description
This simple application allows you to **translate a text** from one language to another through a simple interface, using the [googletrans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/ "googletrans") library.

I am searching for feedback, so feel free of giving your opinion about the app.

I would really appreciate that you give it a try, check the code and comment me about anything that i could improve.

You can have acces to the code [clicking here.](https://github.com/Thadeuks/Translator-Python/blob/master/main.py "clicking here.")

# Requeriments

For this application i used some **packages** that you **will need to run** this program properly, so i made a **list of all the requirements** that you have to install before trying my app:  [You can have access to that clicking here.](https://github.com/Thadeuks/Translator-Python/blob/master/requirements.txt "You can have access to that clicking here")

To install those packages you just have to **create a .txt file** (*recommendably name it "requirements.txt"*) and copy the content of the [requeriments document](https://github.com/Thadeuks/Translator-Python/blob/master/requirements.txt "requeriments document") inside it.

Then execute the next commands on your terminal:

- cd to the directory where the requirements file is saved

`cd <directory where you saved the requirements file>`
- install the packages of the document

` pip install -r   requirements.txt`

in case that you have saved the requirements file with another name (**not recommended**) just put that name instead 'requirements.txt' when you run this command.

Another option is installing the [packages](https://github.com/Thadeuks/Translator-Python/blob/master/requirements.txt "packages") manually one by one (be careful of installing the correct version)

Please try the code and give me your opinion, it would help me a lot
